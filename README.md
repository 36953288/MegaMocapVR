The project also works in Unreal Engine 5, although you may have to chose a pre 4.27 commit!  https://twitter.com/Megasteakman/status/1397830928655814656?s=20

Thanks so much, and I hope this project helps you create awesome streams and animations.  I want this tool to be free for everyone to use, so if you add any features that might benefit others or fix any workflow painpoints I would love to incorporate those changes into the core of VRMocap!

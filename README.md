Before you use that tool, make sure you have watched Megasteakman' youtube video.

If you use vive controller instead of valve index controller. Then you should replace the original VRMocap_Player_pawn_BP with the VRMocap_PlayerPawn_ViveContorller_BP in this submission when you use VRMocap. And change the mapping value input by the controller according to project setting.png, or use project setting input.ini to import directly.

VRMocap is a project for Unreal Engine used to drive humanoid character animation live in editor using steamvr hardware.  This motion can be used in take recorder for the creation of cinematics/animations or be used in streaming for VTuber applicaions.

The project also works in Unreal Engine 5, although you may have to chose a pre 4.27 commit!  https://twitter.com/Megasteakman/status/1397830928655814656?s=20

Thanks so much, and I hope this project helps you create awesome streams and animations.  I want this tool to be free for everyone to use, so if you add any features that might benefit others or fix any workflow painpoints I would love to incorporate those changes into the core of VRMocap!
